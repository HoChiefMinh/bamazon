This is my week 13 homework for the University of Central Florida Bootcamp. In this assignment I created and imported a mySQL database table. Each column of the table include item_id, product_name, department_name, price, and stock_quantity, which we will use to display all items available for sale. We then use inquire to prompt to the user which item they would like to purchase and quantity. I also used for loop to cycle through all items in the db to check inventory levels to see if there are enough to complete the order. 

Bamazon1.png displays the inquire prompts asking user what item they are intrested in ourchasing and how many they would like to buy, and total price aswell as deduction inventory.

Bamazon2.png shows what would happen if user inputs a quantity that is greater than the amount listed in inventory.
